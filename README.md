## Project Overview

This project helps identify the risk of breast cancer by analyzing diagnostic data from patients.  
The core model is a trained **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** using 10 top-ranked features selected for maximum predictive performance and efficiency.

### Key Features:
- Web-based UI developed in Streamlit
- Resettable input fields for easy usability
- Shows prediction probability along with classification
- Compares multiple ML models before selecting the best
- Deployed to Streamlit Cloud for online access

## Models Compared

Before selecting the final model, several machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated on the same dataset:

| Model                 | Performance |
|----------------------|-------------|
| K-Nearest Neighbors  | Compared    |
| Random Forest        | Compared    |
| Logistic Regression  | Compared    |
| **Support Vector Classifier (Final)** | Best Overall |
