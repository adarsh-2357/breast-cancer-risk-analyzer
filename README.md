# breast-cancer-risk-analyzer

A machine learningâ€“powered web application for early detection of breast cancer using the **10 most important diagnostic features**.  
Built with **Streamlit** and deployed locally.

---

## Overview

This project aims to help identify the risk of breast cancer by analyzing a patient's diagnostic data.  
It uses a trained **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** model for predictions, with features selected based on importance scores.

The app includes:
- Streamlit web UI with input sliders
- Sidebar with developer info and GitHub
- Prediction probability output
- Model trained only on top 10 features for efficiency
- Reset button for easy use

## Models Compared

Several models were trained and evaluated before selecting the final one:

| Model                 | Accuracy (approx.) |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| K-Nearest Neighbors  |  Compared |
| Random Forest        |  Compared |
| Logistic Regression  |  Compared |
| **SVC (Final Model)**|  Best overall |
